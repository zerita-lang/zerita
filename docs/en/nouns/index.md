# Nouns

Nouns is the most central part of the speech in order to understand the zerita language.
They have a lot of the intricacies of the language, therefore we will start with them.

Nouns in Zerita have 4 [classes][class], 5 [numbers][number] and 5 [cases][case]. The order of the prefixes and suffixes
is: gender - base - class - number - case.

The [gender], class, and number are the semantic parts of a zeritan noun, and the case is
purely syntactical.

[gender]: ./gender.md
[class]: ./class.md
[number]: ./number.md
[case]: ./cases.md
