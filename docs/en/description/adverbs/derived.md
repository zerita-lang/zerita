# Derived adverbs

Any adjective can be turned into an adverb, by using the -ie suffix:

-   bon -> _bónie_, well
-   mal -> _málie_, badly

The -ie suffix moves the stressed syllable once towards the end.

## Examples

1.  _kantavem bónie tam avisemis._

    -   **translation:** The birds are singing well.
