# Numbers

There is a distinction in the grammatical numbers in zerita between countable and uncountable nouns.
Numbers are formed by adding a suffix to the root word.

### Countable nouns

Countable nouns are nouns that can be counted by an integer: apples, kilograms, humans.
Using "pom", which is the word for "apple," the suffixes are:

-   **Nullar:** -el suffix, used for no items: pomel (no apples).
-   **Fractional:** -ed suffix, used for less than one: pomed (part of an apple).
-   **Singular:** No suffix, used for one item: pom (an apple).
-   **Plural:** -em suffix, used for more than one item: pomem (apples).
-   **Collective:** -er suffix, used for all items: pomer (all apples).

Singular is used for exactly one, fractional for strictly between zero and one, zero for none, and any number more
than 1 is plural or specific (even when it's not full two items). Negative numbers use the number that would have
been used by the number with the same absolute value.

### Uncountable nouns

Uncountable nouns are nouns that they don't have units: water, money, love. As there are no units,
the number names for the fractional, singular and plural numbers, are named paucal, general, and copial
respectively. Using "amor", which is the word for "lov," the suffixes are:

-   **Nullar:** -el suffix, used for the absence: amorel (no love).
-   **Paucal:** -ed suffix, used for a small quantity: amored (a little bit of love).
-   **General:** No suffix, used for one item: amor (love).
-   **Copial:** -em suffix, used for a large quantity: amorem (whole lotta love).
-   **Collective:** -er suffix, used for all items: amorer (all the love).
