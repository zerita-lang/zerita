# Person and Number

In Zerita, there are 4 persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
The 4th person is used to describe total cases, such as zero and collective numbers.
Additionally, the 1st person plural has two forms: inclusive and exclusive.

The person and number suffixes are:

| Number/Person     | 1st | 1st (inc) | 2nd | 3rd | 4th  |
| ----------------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| Nullar            |     |           |     |     | -ulu |
| Fractional/Paucal |     |           |     | -ed |      |
| Singular/General  | -o  |           | -is | -en |      |
| Plural/Copial     | -om | -ome      | -im | -em |      |
| Collective        |     |           |     |     | -ur  |

Zerita is a pro-drop language, so the pronouns aren't necessary, and should only be
used if emphasis is required.
