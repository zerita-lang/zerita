# Genders

Zerita is not a gendered language. The gender has no affect on the grammatical rules,
it's only used to signify the gender of the object, and it's only used when it's
relevant. It's marked by the prefixes vi- and me-, for the male and the female
counterparts, respectively.

!!! note "Using gender"

    By default, unless you want to specify a gender, no gender prefix should be used.
    For example, if you have a son, you should use fil unless you specifically want
    to indicate that your child is a son rather than a daughter.

## Examples:

-   **Parent:** paren

    -   **Father:** viparen
    -   **Mother:** meparen

-   **Child (offspring):** fil

    -   **Son:** vifil
    -   **Daughter:** mefil
