# Type

Zerita has a rich type system for verbs, each one having it's own syntactic rules.
The syntax of each sentence stems from the verb and its type. The basic syntax is
VSO. In cases that the sentence has a topic, it is placed directly after the verb.

## Copular verbs

Copular verbs are verbs that don't have an action, but rather they describe an state
or a characteristic, for example "I am a doctor" or "The roses smell nice". Syntax in
zerita is verb - subject - attribute, where the attribute is in the absolutive case.

1.  _saven ta libris magne._

    -   **translation:** The book is big.
    -   **explanation:** The book is big and the speaker indicates that the book is this is the present state.

1.  _seven ta libris magne._

    -   **translation:** The book is big.
    -   **explanation:** The book is big and the speaker indicates that the book was, is and will always be big.

1.  _savasen ta libris magne._

    -   **translation:** The book is big.
    -   **explanation:** The book is big and the speaker indicates that the book was, is and will be big, but it can change.

1.  _olfavem tam rosemis amareme._

    -   **translation:** The roses smell sweet.

One important case in the copular verbs, is introducing oneself, as in "I'm Jon Snow".
I am the sentence's topic, the name is the subject and Jon Snow is the attribute.

1.  _seven mei ta namis jon snow_

    -   **translation:** I'm Jon Snow.
    -   **literal translation:** Talking about me, the name is Jon Snow.

## Global state verbs

Global state verbs are verbs that describe the state of the world, of a place,
or even a time period. For example they describe things like "it snows",
and they lack subject and the personal suffix.

1.  _nivav._

    -   **translation:** It is snowing.

## Intransitive verbs

Intransitive verbs are verbs that describe an action without a recipient,
for example "the birds are singing", or, verbs that describe an state,
"the cat is sleeping". They follow the syntax verb - subject, and the subject
is in the nominative case.

1.  _kantavem unem avisemis._

    -   **translation:** Birds are singing.

## Transitive verbs

Transitive verbs are verbs that describe an action with a single recipient,
for example "I'm drinking water". They follow the syntax verb - subject - object,
the subject is in the nominative case, and the object in the accusative. The subject
can be dropped, especially in the first, second, and fourth person.

1.  _potavo une akvon._

    -   **translation:** I'm drinking water.

## Distransitive verbs

Distransitive verbs are verbs that describe an action with two recipient,
for example "I'm giving the book to you". They follow the syntax
verb - subject - direct object - indirect object, the subject is in the nominative case,
and the direct object in the accusative and the indirect one is in the dative case.
The subject can be dropped, especially in the first, second, and fourth person.

1.  _donavoso ta libron veim._

    -   **translation:** I am about to give the book to you.

1.  _donavo ta libron ta filim._

    -   **translation:** I am giving the book to the child.

## Reflexivity

Zerita handles reflexivity and reciprocality using pronouns.
