# Classes

There are 4 classes in Zerita. These classes are formed by adding a suffix to the root word.
Using "libr", which is the word for "book," the suffixes are:

-   **Default:** no suffix, it doesn't have any special meaning: libr (a book).
-   **Type:** -an, used for types of things: libran (a type of book).
-   **Abstract:** -as, used for abstract things: libras (a book in the abstract sense).
-   **Cultural:** -ar, used for cultural artifacts: librar (a culturally significant book).

!!! note "Abstract class"

    The abstract class is used to convey the meaning of an item in a non-concrete sense, as a
    general concept. For example, using it in a sentence like "I like pizza": we're not talking
    about a pizza, or a specific pizza, but pizza in general. This is in contrast to
    "I would like a pizza", where we talk about eating the food called pizza itself. Other examples
    include "Love is important" vs "Give me your love" where the first example is talking about love
    as a general concept, and the second is talking about a concrete instance of love
