# Tenses

## Timeless tenses

Zerita has two timeless tenses, the veritas tense, and the stabila.

### Veritas tense

The veritas tense is used to describe a timeless truth, a scientific fact,
or an unchanging state. It's formed using the -ev suffix.

### Stabila tense

The stabila tense is used to express recurring actions, habitual behaviors,
and states that are true within a specific context, regardless of past, present,
or future. It's also used when it's unknown whether the event is in the past, present,
or future. It's formed using the -uv suffix.

!!! note "Using timeless tenses"

    Describing a scientific truth should always use the veritas tense. Talking
    about a habit, even if won't change, we use the stabila tense.
