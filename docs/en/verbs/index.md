# Verbs

Zeritan verbs dictate the form of the sentence, the main syntax,
as it depends strongly on the [verb type][type], and convey a lot of
information through the prefix and suffix system.

Zeritan verbs have 3 [moods][mood] and 14 [tenses][tense]. As zerita
has a nullar and collective number, there are 4 grammatical [persons][person]
to accommodate this.

[mood]: ./mood.md
[tense]: ./tense.md
[type]: ./type.md
[person]: ./person.md
