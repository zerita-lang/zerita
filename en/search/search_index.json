The design choice is always to opt for the more expressive choice, even at the cost of making it more complex, but not more complicated.</p> <p>One other choice that is present throughout zeritan rule is the information flow. Zerita is a language that is meant to be literal, and express the necessary information. For example, in English, a sentence like \"The door was red\", is strongly associated with the past state. The speaker most probably means that the door was read in the past, but not any more. Contrary, in Zerita, \"Sisen ta portis ruje\" means that the door was red, but for the present state of the colour door, you cannot infer anything.</p> <p>Even though zerita is using latin-based languages for the vocabulary, the writing system, and the pronunciation, this isn't true for the grammar and the syntax.

The English equivalent is just the closest sound in English (when the word is pronounced with the received pronunciation).</p> <p>A word without any accent marks will have its penultimate syllable stressed, or the only syllable if the word has a single syllable. If an accent mark is present, it signifies the stressed syllable. For example, \"homis\" (human or person) has the \"o\" as the stressed vowel, \"ni\" (no) has the \"i\" stressed, but \"as\u00e9\" (3rd person pronoun) has the \"e\" stressed.</p> <p>Zerita is using no capitalisation of the letters, no diphthongs, and no silent letters. It uses the following punctuation marks:</p> Mark Name Meaning . Period Indicates the end of a declarative sentence. ; Semicolon Connects closely related independent clauses or separates items in a complex list. , Comma Separates elements in a list, clauses, or phrases within a sentence. : Colon Introduces a list, quotation, or explanation. ! Exclamation Mark Expresses strong emotion or a command. ? Question Mark Indicates a question. \"\" Quotation Marks Encloses direct speech, quotations, or titles of works. <p>Punctuation and quotes</p> <p>Punctuation marks should be placed only outside the double quotes if they both the sentence inside the quotes and outside of it end at the same time.</p> <p>Names that come from other languages keep the original spelling if they are written in the latin alphabet, or they have a standard latinisation, and they written phonetically otherwise. As an aid to the reader, a name that comes from another language can be transliterated in Zerita inside square brackets, the first time it appears in a passage, for example george[jorj].</p>"},{"location":"overview/syntax/","title":"Syntactic structures","text":"<p>We will start our analysis with sentences. A sentence is the largest unit that has a syntactic structure. Bigger parts of a passage still have structure, but it's not a structure that is defined by the zerita syntax.</p> <p>A sentence is a sequence of clauses connected with words like \"ete\" (and). A clause is the smallest part of the sentence that express something, for example a command (Just do it), a conclusion (the butler did it), a question (can you do it?), a description of the state of the world (it's raining men).</p> <p>This informal distinction comes with some interesting edge cases. Consider the following sentences:</p> <ul> <li>You study hard and you will pass your exams.</li> <li>If you study hard, then you will pass your exams.</li> <li>If you study hard, then you will pass your exams, else you'll fail.</li> </ul> <p>How many clauses does each of the sentences have? If they are more than one, are they treated as equals?</p> <p>The approach that zerita takes is sentences have nodes, and all nodes are equal. There is no main node. Not all nodes are present, and there phantom nodes. Each node contains at least one a clause. It contains one main clause and any number of subordinate ones.</p> <p>Let's split the above examples in nodes and each node in clauses.</p> <ul> <li>You study hard and you will pass your exams.<ul> <li>First node: You study hard</li> <li>node connector: and</li> <li>Second node: you will pass your exams</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you study hard, then you will pass your exams.<ul> <li>First node: If you study hard, then you will pass your exams<ul> <li>Subordinate clause: If you study hard</li> <li>clause connector: then</li> <li>main clause: you will pass your exams</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>If you study hard, then you will pass your exams, else you'll fail.<ul> <li>First node: If you study hard, then you will pass your exams<ul> <li>subordinate clause: if you study hard</li> <li>clause connector: then</li> <li>main clause: you will pass your exams</li> </ul> </li> <li>node connector: else</li> <li>Second node:<ul> <li>subordinate phantom clause: if you don't study hard</li> <li>main clause: you'll fail</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The final multi-word syntactic structure that we focus on, is the phrase, which is just a sequence of connected words, for example \"the big bad wolf\".</p>"},{"location":"questions/interrogatives/","title":"Questions","text":"<p>Questions in zerita are formed by the question particle + the sentence, in the affirmative syntax, with the unknown part missing.
