# Adjectives

Adjectives in zerita decline exactly the same as nouns do. They are placed after the noun
that the describe in order of importance, for example both mean big new knife:

-   une koltis magnis novis
-   une koltis novis magnis

There is an slight difference in intention. The first means that it's a big new knife,
but the second means the knife is noticeably new, and maybe so shiny that you'll notice this
first.

The number of the adjective always agrees with the nouns that it modifies:

-   _une furkis ete une koklis magnesis_

    -   **translation:** a big fork and a big spoon
    -   **notes:** Specific number is used, as they are two.

-   _une furkis ete une koklis magnis_

    -   **translation:** a fork and a big spoon

## Examples

-   _saven tis domis magnis es bele._

    -   **translation:** the big house is beautiful.

-   _saven tis domis es magne ete bele._

    -   **translation:** the house is big and beautiful.
